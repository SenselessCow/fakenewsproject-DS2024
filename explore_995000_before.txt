Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           20074

BRUSSELS (AFP) – EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Brussels next Thursday, the European Commission said, following months of strained relations.\n\nJuncker, who heads the European Commission, and Tusk, who heads the council of 28 EU member states, are due to meet Erdogan on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Brussels.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“President Jean-Claude Juncker, together with (EU Council) President Donald Tusk, meets Mr Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President of Turkey, in Brussels,” Juncker’s office said Friday in a calendar entry for May 25.\n\nRelations between the bloc and Ankara took a hit after a failed coup attempt in July, and worsened further during the campaign for the April 16 referendum on strengthening Erdogan’s powers.\n\nEarlier this month, Erdogan told Brussels it had no other “option” than to open new “chapters”, or policy areas, in Turkey’s long-stalled accession talks which began in 2005.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted at the time that Turkey was not seeking to become an adversary to the EU, but complained about the approach.\n\nHe said only 16 policy chapters had been opened out of a total of 35 since the negotiations began, even though Ankara’s bid to be a part of the bloc dates back to the 1960s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1

Young people are willing to go to any lengths to get on the house ladder\n\nThe lengths would-be buyers aged 18 to 34 are willing to go to also includes moving back in with their parents and delaying plans to get married.\n\nAnd the vast majority blame the Tory-led Coalition for pricing them out of the housing market.\n\nIn the poll, 87 per cent say it is too difficult for the younger generation to buy a home and 40 per cent believe the Government pays most attention to businesses when forming housing policies.\n\nJust three per cent think that the Government listens to younger buyers when drawing up plans, says the National Housing Federation.\n\nWith the average first-time buyer now needing a £30,000 deposit, 14 per cent are moving back in with parents, 12 per cent have or are thinking of taking a second job – and one in 25 have or are considering taking part in paid medical research.\n\nDavid Orr, chief executive of the NHF, said: “Our polling of young people underlines the stark reality of their situation and how they feel like they are shouting into a void.\n\n“They are just not being listened to by government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1
CNN promoting coup in Venezuela - Maduro\n\nOn Monday the President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro stated that the CNN Spanish network was promoting a coup d'état as part of a wider media war against the country's socialist government.\n\n"CNN en Español is a network controlled by those seeking destabilization, which openly urges people to carry out a coup d'état in Venezuela, and which is delivering a distorted version of our nation's political and social life," Maduro on national television.\n\nSpanish-language CNN is part of a wider campaign of "brutal psychological warfare" led by the "fascist right-wing" seeking his government's demise, Maduro said.\n\n"CNN en Español has become the spearhead for promoting intervention against our nation," Maduro warned.\n\nVoice of Russia, AFP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1
